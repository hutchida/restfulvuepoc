# Restful Vue Project
Demo Vue table project.

## Getting started

# install dependencies

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

## Debugging
It's possible to walk through the JavaScript code (just like C# in Visual Studio) by running the project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Debugger for Chrome](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/02/23/introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code) extension enabled. In the debug panel select the `Chrome` configuration, add a break point and then press then play button.
